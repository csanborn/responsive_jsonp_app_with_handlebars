# responsive_jsonp_app_with_handlebars

Task: create a responsive layout of a Wordpress feed utilizing jsonp. The app uses plain javascript and Handlebars as well as css columns and media queries. There's a click listener on the document that handles the various button events. The story excerpt is spread across one column and the full story uses a maximum of four columns. The text change for the expand/collapse button is handled through the :after pseudo class. This is optimized for Chrome.
